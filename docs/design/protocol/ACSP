    ARCHKE client-server protocol (ACSP)

Simple string

    Pattern: +<string-in-ascii-encoding>\r\n

    Must not contain CR(\r) or LF(\n)

Bulk String

    Pattern: $<length>\r\n<binary-data>

    "length" - the string's length (in bytes), encoded in ASCII

Arrays

    Pattern: *<number-of-elements>\r\n<element-1>...<element-n>

    "number-of-elements" - number of elements, encoded in ASCII

Simple errors

    -<string-in-ascii-encoding>\r\n

    Must not contain CR(\r) or LF(\n)

    Examples:
        -ERR unknown command 'asdf'

        The first upper-case word after the -, up to the first space or newline,
        represents the kind of error returned. This word is called an error prefix.
        Note that the error prefix is a convention used by ARCHKE

Command execution user request

    Pattern: ^<length>\r\n<packet-data>

    "length" - the packet's length (in bytes), encoded in ASCII




SET command

    Creates key-value pairs. if the key already holds a value, it is overwritten

    Example of SET command, encoded:

    Request:
	    ^20\r\n*3\r\n+SET\r\n$5\r\nMYKEY$6\r\nMYVALUE

    Responses:
        Success:
            +OK\r\n

        Error:
            -ERR <cause>\r\n

    This command creates a key-value pair "MYKEY"->"MYVALUE"
